### Introduction

The Sipcentric PBX is a cloud-based phone service...

The Sipcentric Developer API, based around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles, allows users to interact with core features of the Sipcentric PBX platform and integrate with their own applications. The API makes it possible to programtically manage features, query data and perform more interesting things such as initiating calls, sending text messages and hooking into specific realtime events and notifications (perfect for [screen popping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_pop)).

### Current Version

The current stable version is V1 and its base URL is:

```
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1
```

Because the API follows many common REST design patterns, it is extremely easy to get started and is for the most part, self-documenting. Full documentation for this version, however, can be found [here](/api/v1).
