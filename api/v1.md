# API v1

## Overview

#### Base URL

All resource URIs referenced in this documentation have the following base:
```
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1
```

All API requests should be made over HTTPS, rather than over HTTP.

#### Limits

To prevent individual applications from degrading the overall user experience, we limit the number of requests that can be made in any **60 minute** window to **1200 per user**.

This limit is not intended to restrict your creativity in any way, so if you need more please email support@sipcentric.com detailing your requirements. However, you are encouraged to cache information locally, wherever possible, and to design your application in a way which avoids unnecessary or repeat requests.

You can see your current status by checking the HTTP headers included in each response from us:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: the number of requests allowed per 60 minute window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: the number of requests left for the 60 minute window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: the number of seconds before next reset

For example:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1200
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 11
```

#### HTTP Methods

Instead of defining its own, arbitrary methods, the Sipcentric API utilizes four standard HTTP methods for interaction with all resources as follows:

##### GET

*Retrieving* a representation of a resource is as easy as GETting its URI. A simple way to test this is to type the URI of the desired resource into the address bar of your web browser.

###### Response Codes

| Status Code | Type              | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----              | -----------                                                                                  |
| 200         | Ok                | Your request was successful and the response body contains the representation.               |
| 304         | Not Modified      | The client's cached representation is still valid (conditional GET).                         |  
| 401         | Unauthorized      | The credentials supplied are invalid, or insufficient to access the requested resource.      |  
| 404         | Not Found         | No resource was found at the requested location.                                             |  
| 429         | Too Many Requests | You have reached your request limit for the current time window.                             |  
| 500         | Server Error      | Something went wrong our end. If the problem persists please contact support@sipcentric.com. |  

##### POST

The POST method is used for *creating* resources. The representation of the object to be created should be contained within the request body, and the `Content-Type` header should be set according to the format you are sending, e.g. `application/xml` or `application/json`. See [Response Formats](#response-formats) for the formats we can accept.

| 500         | Server Error       | The server has responded with an error. If the problem persists please contact support@sipcentric.com.               |  

##### PUT

You should use the PUT method to *update* or *modify* resources. A representation of the object and its updated properties should be included in the body, and the `Content-Type` header set according to the format of the representation you are sending. See [Response Formats](#response-formats) for the formats we can accept.

##### DELETE

Finally, where supported, resources may be *removed* using the DELETE method. Please be careful though, as deleted resources cannot be restored afterwards!

| 204         | Deleted            | The resource was successfully deleted. The response body will be empty as there is no representation to return. |  
| 401         | Unauthorized       | The credentials supplied are invalid, or insufficient to delete the resource.                                   |

| 429         | Too Many Requests  | You have reached your request limit for the current time window.                                                |  
| 500         | Server Error       | The server has responded with an error. If the problem persists please contact support@sipcentric.com.          |  

##### Method Overloading

Not all HTTP libraries support the PUT and DELETE methods. However, it is possible to achieve the same outcome by using POST and including a `_method` query parameter in the request URL, with a value of either PUT or DELETE. For example, take the following DELETE request:

```
DELETE /customers/8425/numbers/44675
```

If your chosen library only supports GET or POST, this request can easily be simulated as follows:

```
POST /customers/8425/numbers/44675?_method=DELETE
```

#### Authentication

Authentication to the Sipcentric API occurs via [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_authentication_scheme), with the same credentials as you would use to login to the web portal. Your credentials should be provided with every request.

Most HTTP libraries will handle Basic Authentication details automatically. To do it manually, include an `Authorization` header with a value of `Basic <credentials>` in every request, where “credentials” is a Base64-encoded version of the string "username:password". For example:

```
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
```

As all Sipcentric accounts can have unlimited users, you may want to create a user specifically for the API, or for an application that uses the API.

Users must authenticate at one of three levels:

- Extension User
- Company Admin
- Reseller

Company Admin and Reseller accounts are both able to access all resources on all accounts that they have access to. Extension user's access is detailed below:

| Resource                          | Extension User         | Company Admin          | Reseller               |  
| --------                          | --------------         | -------------          | --------               |  
| /customers                        | GET                    | GET                    | GET                    |

| /customers/{id}/recordings        | NONE                   | GET                    | GET                    |  
| /customers/{id}/timeintervals     | GET                    | GET                    | GET                    |

| /customers/{id}/callbundles       | NONE                   | GET                    | GET                    |  
| /customers/{id}/sip               | GET (own)              | GET                    | GET                    |  
| /customers/{id}/voicemail         | GET (own)              | GET                    | GET                    |  


#### Response Formats

We generally send (and receive) representations of objects in [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. There may be exceptions (in the case of sound files, for example), but these will be highlighted in the documentation specific to those resources.

For each request you should specify the `Accept` header, which we will evaluate and where possible, return a representation according to your preferred choice. For example:

```
Accept: application/json
```

Although includng the `Accept` header in your request is the preferred method of specifying your desired representation format, it may not always be possible to include this header.

If an `Accept` header cannot be specified, you can append the desired type to the request URL instead, as in the example below.

```html
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/calls.json
```

This will override any `Accept` headers that have been added by your client and, in the above example, return a JSON representation.

#### List Resources

Some resources are in fact collections of other resources. For example, a list of all telephone
numbers assigned to a particular customer account can be found by querying (GETting) the
“phonenumbers” sub-resource. Similarly, new numbers can be added to the collection by POSTing to it.

##### Pagination

In some cases, lists of items can be quite long. To preserve bandwidth and reduce response time,
lists are instead divided across multiple pages. To assist with pagination, a list resource will always
contain the following information:

| Property   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| totalItems | The total number of items in the collection.                 |
| pageSize   | The number of items per page.                                |
| page       | The current page number.                                     |
| items[]    | The items included in the current page.                      |
| prevPage   | A link to the previous page (if it exists).                  |
| nextPage   | A link to the next page (again, if it exists).               |


Example request:

```
GET https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers?pageSize=5&page=2
```

```response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "totalItems": 21,
  "pageSize": 5,
  "page": 2,
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "did",
      "uri": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers/2468",
      ...
    },
    {
      "type": "did",
      "uri": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers/1365",
      ...
    },
    {
      "type": "did",
      "uri": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers/4775",
      ...
    },
    {
      "type": "did",
      "uri": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers/2164",
      ...
    },
    {
      "type": "did",
      "uri": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers/3647",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "prevPage": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers?pageSize=5&page=1",
  "nextPage": "https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/1234/phonenumbers?pageSize=5&page=3"
}
    
```

##### Query Parameters

Some list resources will have specific parameters that can be used to filter results (see individual resource
documentation for details). However as a minimum, all list resources support the following query
parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pageSize   | The number of items per page (default 20 / maximum 200).     |
| page       | The page number to return (default 1).                       |


For example, to limit results to 10 per page and return the second page:

`GET /customers/8425/phonenumbers?pageSize=10&page=2`


#### Data Formats

##### Dates & Times

All dates and times are formatted according to the ISO 8601 profile. For example:

`2012-09-26T13:47:28Z`


## Customer Resources

#### Customers

| Resource Information           |             |

| Location                       | /customers  |  
| Rate Limited?                  | Yes         |  
| Requests per rate limit window | 1200/hour   |  
| Authentication                 | Basic Auth  |  
| HTTP Method(s)                 | [GET](#get) |  
| JSON Representation(s)         | customer    |  
| Additional Formats             | None        |  

A customer resource represents an instance of an account on the Sipcentric platform - it encapsulates a single company/PBX and all of its sub-resources.

##### List customers

`GET /customers`

The list resource located at `/customers` lists all customers to which the authenticating user has access. When authenticated as an extension user or a company admin, this will only return their own customer account. However, when authenticated as a reseller, all customer accounts owned by that reseller will be returned.

Example request:

```
GET https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers
```


```response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  "totalItems": 1,
  "pageSize": 1,

##### Get customer

`GET /customers/{customerId}`

Returns a single customer, providing the user is allowed access to that customer. In the case of company admin/extension users, the special ID of `me` can also be used to return the customer account to which the current user belongs.

Example request:

```
GET https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/me
```

#### Token Generator

In some situations it's not possible to use basic authentication in a GET request, such as downloading a call recording in a client's browser.

To solve this issue we have added a token generator for pre authenticating these requests. This will return a single-use token for accessing any readonly resources 
you would normally have to authenticate for.

```

You can now use this token to get a call recording using the `tokenid` parameter in the GET request:

```http
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/25/recordings/242348.wav?tokenid=318f9a6d-162e-4d46-89d2-3d7cb2f4db16
```

Anyone that tried to use the request again will get a 401 Unauthorized. This prevents replay attacks from getting any data.

#### Stream

You can create a standing HTTP connection to our API for live streaming data. This means you can process events in near real time, without having to poll other resources and potentially hit request limits. Currently the following is available via the streaming API:

- Incoming call notifications
- Received SMS messages

Data is returned as JSON objects.

Example:

```
{NEEDS_EXAMPLE}
```
