# API v1

## Introduction

The Sipcentric RESTful API provides a way of integrating your own apps, scripts or mashups with
our hosted VoIP platform. It allows you to set up and manage your virtual PBX, query data and
even perform more interesting things such as initiating calls, sending text messages and hooking
into specific events (perfect for screen popping).

###### **Important:** The API is currently in a beta state. Although unlikely, breaking changes *may* occur.

## Base URL

All resource URIs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

    http://pbx.sipcentric.com/api
    
You can navigate to this in a web browser.

## HTTP Methods

### GET

Retrieving a representation of a resource is as easy as GETting its URI. A simple way to test this is
to type the URI of the desired resource into the address bar of your web browser.

**Response Codes**

* **200 OK:** Your request was successful and the response body contains the representation.
* **304 Not Modified:** The client's cached representation is still valid (conditional GET).
