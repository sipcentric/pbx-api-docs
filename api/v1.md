# API V1

## Overview

#### Introduction

The Sipcentric API, based around REST, allows users to interact with core features and information on the Sipcentric platform.

All resource URIs referenced in this documentation have the following base:
```
http://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1
```

#### Limits

To prevent individual applications from degrading the overall user experience, we limit the number of requests that can be made in any **60 minute** window to **1200 per user**.

This limit is not intended to restrict your creativity in any way, so if you need more please email support@sipcentric.com detailing your requirements. However, you are encouraged to cache information locally, wherever possible, and to design your application in a way which avoids unnecessary or repeat requests.

You can see your current status by checking the HTTP headers included in each response from us:

- X-RateLimit-Limit: the number of requests allowed per 60 minute window
- X-RateLimit-Remaining: the number of requests left for the 60 minute window
- X-RateLimit-Reset: the number of seconds before next reset

For example:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1200
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 11
```

#### HTTP Methods

Instead of defining its own, arbitrary methods, the Sipcentric API utilizes four standard HTTP methods for interaction with all resources as follows:

##### GET

*Retrieving* a representation of a resource is as easy as GETting its URI. A simple way to test this is to type the URI of the desired resource into the address bar of your web browser.

##### POST

The POST method is used for *creating* resources. The representation of the object to be created should be contained within the request body, and the **Content-Type** header should be set according to the format you are sending, e.g. `application/xml` or `application/json`. See [Response Formats](#response-formats) for the formats we can accept.

##### PUT

You should use the PUT method to *update* or *modify* resources. A representation of the object and its updated properties should be included in the body, and the **Content-Type** header set according to the format of the representation you are sending. See [Response Formats](#response-formats) for the formats we can accept.

##### DELETE

Finally, where supported, resources may be *removed* using the DELETE method. Please be careful though, as deleted resources cannot be restored afterwards!

##### Method Overloading

Not all HTTP libraries support the PUT and DELETE methods. However, it is possible to achieve the same outcome by using POST and including a **_method** query parameter in the request URL, with a value of either PUT or DELETE. For example, take the following DELETE request:

```
DELETE /customers/8425/numbers/44675
```

If your chosen library only supports GET or POST, this request can easily be simulated as follows:

```
POST /customers/8425/numbers/44675?_method=DELETE
```

#### Authentication

Authentication to the the Sipcentric API occurs via [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_authentication_scheme), with the same credentials as you would use to login to the web portal. Your credentials should be provided with every request.

Most HTTP libraries will handle Basic Authentication details automatically. To do it manually, include an Authorization header with a value of “Basic <credentials>” in every request, where “credentials” is a Base64-encoded version of the string username:password. For example:

```
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
```

As all Sipcentric accounts can have unlimited users, you may want to create a user specifically for the API, or for a program that uses the API.

Users must authenticate at one of three levels:

- Extension User
- Company Admin
- Reseller

Company Admin and Reseller accounts are both able to access all resources on all accounts that they have access to. Extension user's access is detailed below:

| Resource                          | Extension User         | Company Admin          | Reseller               |  
| --------                          | --------------         | -------------          | --------               |  
| /customers                        | GET                    | GET                    | GET                    |

| /customers/{id}/voicemail         | GET (own)              | GET                    | GET                    |  

Authentication is currently required for all resources, and all API requests should be made over HTTPS, rather than over HTTP.

#### Request Formats

Query strings have several common parameters that can be used with any resource. Query string parameters are added by appending them to the query URI with a question mark `?`, subsequent query parameters are then added using an ampersand `&` as in the example below.

```
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/25/sms?pageSize=2&page=1
```

Some query parameters are common across all resources, all of which are outlined below.

| Common Query Parameters | Type    | Description                                       |  
| ----------------------- | ----    | -----------                                       |  
| pageSize                | Integer | The number of items to include per page (max 200) |  
| page                    | Integer | The page number to return                         |  


All requests should include the **Accept** header, which we will then evaluate and, where possible, return a representation according to your preferred choice. For example:

```
Accept: application/json
```

Although included the **Accept** header in your request is the preferred method of specifying your returned representation format, it may not always be possible to include this header.

If an **Accept** header cannot be specified, you can also specify a content-type override within your query string, as in the example below.

```html
/customers/25/calls.json
```

This will override any **Accept** headers that have been specified by your client and, in the above example, return a JSON representation.

#### Response Formats

We generally send (and receive) representations of objects in [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). There may be exceptions (in the case of sound files, for example), but these will be highlighted in the documentation specific to those resources.

All responses will include a HTTP status code. Some of the most common status codes that each type of request may return, along with it's definitions, are listed below.

##### List customers

The root resource located at https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers lists all customers that the user has access to on the account. When authenticated as an extension user, or a company admin, this will only return their own customer account, however when authenticated as a reseller all customer accounts that that reseller has access to will be returned.

`GET /customers`

Example request:

```
GET https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers?pageSize=1&page=1

#### Token Generator

In some situations it's not possible to use basic authentication in a GET request, such as downloading a call recording in a client's browser.

To solve this issue we have added a token generator for pre authenticating these requests. This will return a single-use token for accessing any readonly resources 
you would normally have to authenticate for.

##### Get token

```
GET https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/tokengenerator

{
  "type": "authtoken",
  "id": "318f9a6d-162e-4d46-89d2-3d7cb2f4db16",
  "created": "2014-07-11T15:11:12.477+0000",
  "expires": "2014-07-11T16:11:12.477+0000"
}
```

You can now use this token to get a call recording using the `tokenid` parameter in the GET request:

```http
https://pbx.sipcentric.com/api/v1/customers/25/recordings/242348.wav?tokenid=318f9a6d-162e-4d46-89d2-3d7cb2f4db16
```

Anyone that tried to use the request again will get a 401 Unauthorized. This prevents replay attacks from getting any data.

#### Stream

You can create a standing HTTP connection to our API for live streaming data. This means you can process events in near real time, without having to poll other resources and potentially hit request limits. Currently the following is available via the streaming API:

- Incoming call notifications
- Received SMS messages

Data is returned as JSON objects.

Example:

```
{NEEDS_EXAMPLE}
```
